Application
    poroMechanicalFoam

Description
    specialist solver for geotechnical problems, based on solids4foam,
    where the solved mathematical model (fluid, solid or fluid-solid)
    is chosen at run-time.

    We choose a physicsModel which might either be
    solid -> pure solid, e.g. dry / drained
    poroFluid -> pure groundwater 
    poroSolid -> coupled flow deformation

    Depending on the choice the physicsModel object is 
    INTERNALLY (not known to this application, the application
    only knows the interfaces provided by the physicsModel class)
    one of the following:
    -> solidModel
    -> poroFluidModel
    -> poroSolidInterface

    We call the "new" function of one of these classes.

    We then proceed with the time loop. where we periodically call the
    evolve function of the physicsModel object (not class! internally
    this is the run-time chosen model and the physicsModel evolve function 
    is overwritten by the chosen model evolve function)
